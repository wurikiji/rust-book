This repository contains the source code materials that are presented in
[The Rust Programming Language](https://github.com/rust-lang/book).

Some of the code contains my thought and the solutions for exercises.
Be careful that the solutions are not optimal because I am in the learning phase.
File and folder structures are not optimal, too.
